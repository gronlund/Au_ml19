    "# The Hello World of Supervised Learning with python and the sklearn package\n",
    "This exercise shows the high level interface to supervised learning using Python and Sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised Learning we want to learn/approximate some unknown target function $f$ that maps data to whatever value we are interested in.\n",
    "To achieve this goal we are given a data set $D=\\{(x_1,y_1),\\dots,(x_n,y_n))\\}$ where $y_i = f(x_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises we will focus on classifaction tasks where $f(x_i)\\in \\{0,\\dots,k-1\\}$ for a problem with $k$ output classes.\n",
    "For instance for the problem of Spam Detection, f would be the function that takes as input an email and outputs whehter it is spam or not spam.\n",
    "If we represent an email by a string, then $f$ is a mapping from strings to \\{0, 1\\}, 0 indicating not spam, and 1 indicating spam.\n",
    "To learn this function we are given a list of spam mails (strings) and associated labels (spam, not spam)\n",
    "\n",
    "The very basic supervised learning approach is as follows.\n",
    "* Decide on a (parameterized) set of functions $H$ that we think can be used approximate $f$ on new data. \n",
    "* Use a *learning algorithm* on data $D$ to select a good $h\\in H$ that approximates $f$ well.\n",
    "* Apply h on data you care about about.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measure used to select $h \\in H$ by the learning algorithm is defined over the data and designed by the machine learning engineer. It is supposed to encode what a good solution looks like, i.e. what function we prefer over others i.e. a function that minimize a relevant measure on the data, hopefully approximate $f$ well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems a standard quality measure for a classifier is accuracy: \n",
    "which is the probability that the classifier returns the correct label to a **randomly selected unknown data point**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a data set of points and their labels the algorithm has not considered in the learning algorithm that selected $h$,\n",
    "we simply estimate the accuracy of a $h$ as the proportion of data points the algorithm classifies correctly,\n",
    "i.e. let $D=\\{(x_1,y_1),\\dots,(x_n,y_n))\\}$ be data sat of points $x_i$ with labels $y_i$ \n",
    "the accuracy is then the number of data point $x_i$ where $h(x_i) = y_i$ divided by n, i.e. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n 1 \\textrm{ if }{h(x_i) = y_i} \\textrm{ else } 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough theory talking. Lets demonstrate with some simple python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Classifier Interface\n",
    "The function/learning algorithm $h$ are represented as an object that supports at least the methods **fit, predict, and score**.\n",
    "* fit(X, y), fit the data with learning algorithm on data X with labels y \n",
    "* predict(X), return the prediction of the fitted classifer on data points in X\n",
    "* score(X, y), compute the accuracy of the classifier on data X with labels y\n",
    "\n",
    "In general $X, y$ will be numpy arrays (a numpy array is a matrix/multidimensional container). With $n$ data points, $X$ is a matrix of shape $(n, d)$ where $d$ is the dimensionality of an input point and $y$ is a numpy array with shape $(n,)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a code example see next cell for the implementation of a very bad classifier.\n",
