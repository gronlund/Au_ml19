# Week 5 Exercises
The exercises for week 5 can be found below. Remember to look at all the exercises before class.

Now get started with the exercises (download the notebook to work with it).

The pretrained weights are needed for testing the neural net implementatiotion.

The starter code is needed for the two coding exercises.

The suggested order is as follows.
* [Theory Exercises](theory.ipynb)
* [Pretrained Weights for Ex 2 in theory.ipynb - keep in same folder](good_weights.npz)
* [Starter Code - Adaboost](adaboost.py)
* [Starter code - Forward Additive Modelling](sfam.py)
